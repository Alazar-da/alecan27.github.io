<h4>About My self</h4>
My name is Alazar. I live in Ethiopia. In the past few years, I was learning programming through YouTube videos. I did not give much attention to programming before. Because I was not committed to it. For example, the first language that I started was c++ and, I did not get in too deep. Right now, what I need is to  I am focusing on web designing. Know I am in a university and, I will fix my time to learn. I am excited to learn from you. I hope you accept me.

<p>I and my friends were practiced in a science fair project. We designed a website app that includes an e-Library and only chatting. We did not finish it fully. We thought we were going to sell it to the school but it did not work. I can say this was my first venture. </p>
